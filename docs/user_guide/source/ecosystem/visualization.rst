Visualizing Data

.. note::

   As of version 2.5.0 this work is experimental. As it builds on top of the library in third party ecosystems, and doesn't ship with ADIOS 2 source code.

Certain ADIOS 2 bp files, and in-memory streams in the future), can be recognized by third party products to enable data visualization. The expectation is to keep adding support to the list of products enabling ADIOS 2 for visualization purposes. The goal of this section is to describe the currently cover cases and how to create an ADIOS 2 BP file to accomodate the visualization product requirements.
